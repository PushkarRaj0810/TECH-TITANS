# CivicTrack

CivicTrack is an app that lets people report and track local issues in their neighborhood â€” like potholes, garbage, water leaks, or broken lights.

## What You Can Do

1. View nearby issues within 1 to 5 km
2. Report problems with a title, description, category, and up to 3 photos
3. Submit reports anonymously or as a verified user
4. See issues displayed on a map
5. Filter issues by category, status, or distance
6. Receive updates when an issue status changes
7. Flag spam or incorrect reports
8. Admins can manage flagged content, ban users, and view analytics
