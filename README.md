# CivicTrack: Full‚ÄëStack Integrator

Empower citizens to report and track local civic issues within a 1‚Äì5‚ÄØkm radius through photos, filters, notifications, and moderation‚Äîbuilt using Node.js, Next.js, PostGIS, AWS S3, and Leaflet.

---

## üöß Project Overview

**CivicTrack** is a full-stack civic engagement platform that enables community members to:

- Report issues like **potholes, broken lights, water leaks, garbage pickup, open manholes**, and more‚Äîall anonymously or as a verified user.
- Attach up to **35 photos** per issue using client-side uploads to **AWS S3** via presigned URLs ([AWS guide]:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}).
- Visualize, filter, and interact only with issues **within 1‚ÄØkm, 3‚ÄØkm, or 5‚ÄØkm** of the user‚Äôs current location or chosen point (based on `ST_DWithin` + GiST index) for performant radius querying in PostGIS ([PostGIS doc]:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}).
- View a detailed **status timeline** with timestamps (Status: Reported ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Resolved).
- Flag spam or invalid reports; issues hidden automatically after **‚â•‚ÄØ3 flags**, and supported by an admin moderation panel.
- Optional **Open311 GeoReport v2** endpoints (`services.json`, `requests.json`) for interoperability with municipal systems ([Open311 spec]:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}).
